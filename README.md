# Papot-Transaction-Monitoring-System
A System Requirement to the course Information Management school year 2020-2021

The transaction monitoring system’s objective is to monitor the transactions made to their suppliers. It shows the information of the products and the unit prices from their transaction. It also indicates the status of their orders, supplier’s information and the total cost of their deal. It will help the business to easily compare and locate the origin of the product so they can make better decisions when gathering their supplies and easily understand the breakdowns of their investment.
